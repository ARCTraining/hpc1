These notes are based on our [HPC user documentation](https://arcdocs.leeds.ac.uk/aire/welcome.html), adapted for presentation and learning as opposed to reference.

## Content

The purpose of the workshop is to introduce research computing and high performance computing (HPC) at Leeds and getting you some hands-on experience with Linux and our HPC platforms. You will learn how to use different software and run code your code on the HPC platform, how to submit batch jobs and request different resources, where to store your data, and how to leverage simple parallelisation.

This course will be useful to learners who are completely new to High Performance Computing, or to those with some experience of HPC elsewhere but new to the platforms and resources at Leeds.

Basic experience with the Linux command line and some programming experience would be very useful. If you are unfamiliar with the Unix shell we would encourage you to attend [HPC0: Introduction to Command Line Linux](https://arc.leeds.ac.uk/courses/hpc0-introduction-to-linux-for-hpc/). This is not an introductory programming workshop (see workshops [SWD1a: Introduction to Python programming](https://arc.leeds.ac.uk/training/courses/swd1a/), [SWD1b: Introduction to R programming](https://arc.leeds.ac.uk/training/courses/swd1b/) if that is what you need).

## Objectives

In this course, we cover:

- Transferring data to and from HPC resources
- Managing storage on HPC resources
- Job submission, monitoring and cancellation
- Accessing different software on the HPC system
- Developing scripts to run codes and applications
- Benchmarking and analysing how jobs scale

This course includes practical exercises and hands-on coding that you will be guided through. Note that this course expects basic familiarity with the Linux command line.

## Prerequisites

For this course, you will need an account on the HPC system at Leeds Aire. You will also need a method of connecting to Aire from your machine.
